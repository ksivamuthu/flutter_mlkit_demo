# Flutter ML Kit Demo

Building “smarter” applications is a popular and important topic in the mobile development world. Machine Learning is the primary tool used to create apps that improve their delivered value by dynamically adjusting as more relevant data is made available. ML Kit and Flutter, which is Google’s mobile SDK for building native Android and iOS apps from a single codebase, can build apps with machine learning capabilities. In this session, we will explore how to use Flutter to leverage ML Kit’s functionalities and how we can train custom models using Google Cloud AutoVision API. The demo includes how to export the models to infer in the mobile app using Flutter and Firebase MLKit.
